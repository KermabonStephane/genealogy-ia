# Genealogy Tree Module

## 📋 Overview
The `genealogy-tree` module provides a modern, clean object model for representing genealogical data. It defines core entities like Person, Family, Event, and their relationships using Java 25 Records and Clean Architecture principles.

## 🏗️ Architecture
This module follows Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles:
- **Entities**: Core domain objects (Person, Family, Event, Place, etc.)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable data structures (Name, Date, Location, etc.)
- **Aggregates**: Logical groupings of related entities

## 📦 Features
- **Modern Java 25**: Uses Records for immutable data structures
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for all genealogical concepts
- **Clean Design**: Separation of concerns and single responsibility
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new entity types and relationships

## 🔍 Usage
Coming soon - this module is under active development.

## 🧪 Testing
Unit tests use **Spock Framework** for expressive, readable test specifications.
